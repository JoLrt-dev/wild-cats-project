# wild-cats-project

This is my first ever JavaScript project, made with ðŸ§¡ at the Wild Code School with an awesome team of 4 cat-lovers. 
It consist on a quick Memory Game, with Leader Board stored in your local storage. 

Version 2.0 is coming soon : I'd love to add levels with more cards, or a sound-pairing system.
